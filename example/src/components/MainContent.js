    <h2>React Layout is the simple solution to app layout in React.</h2>
    <p>
      React Layout uses the power of portals to give you a declarative way to
      create complex layouts across different pages in your app. Design each
      layout pattern once, then reuse them across your application as you like.

    <h3>Unchain your content</h3>
    <p>
      Creating great experiences quickly becomes complicated when your content
      has to worry about what kind of layout it's being rendered in. With React
      Layout, you simply label each piece of content by its role and let the
      page layout worry about how to arrange it. This makes it easy to build
      responsive apps without building any sizing logic into the content itself.
