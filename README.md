## A Note

I wouldn't recommend using this if you happen to come across it. This is more of a tech demo than a real solution. I wanted to play around with a technique I might call "context-based rendering" where a global context is used to coordinate portal-based rendering of various parts of the UI to ignore / jump over the rest of the tree structure.

In practice I think breaking the tree is probably a bad idea and hard to reason about / maintain.
